# The-Simply-Complex-task-of-implementing-kubernetes-ingress

Getting traffic into a Kubernetes cluster is actually fairly complex. Building on a blog post on Kubernetes ingress I wrote awhile back, I gave a talk at Velocity NYC earlier this week on the nuances of ingress.
One of the key points I made is that Kubernetes ingress is a bit misnamed — it’s really a way to describe Layer 7 routing semantics in your cluster. When I think about ingress, I think about all the different things that need to happen to get traffic into your cluster.
Other things I talk about:
API gateway versus service mesh
Modern requirements: resilience, tracing, etc.
Pop quiz: how many different NGINX-based ingress controllers exist?
The slides from my talk are below:
